Config.json file has menustructure, which includes mainmenu and submenus that produces grid-boxes to the UI.
In each grid-box menu you can add assets or actions in array "items". 

Example format for ad insertion: Attribute adBreaks shall contain a list of objects, representing individual adBreak. Each adBreak representation shall have *position* in second or special word "preroll" or "postroll" to be set the break in the beginning or in the end of content video. Each adBreak also shall have attribute *ads* to tell how many ads are inserted to specific break
```json
{
	"title": "Linear advert insertion",
	"url": "videos/manifest.mpd",
	"img": "icons/icons_1x1_insert-ad.png",
	"app": 6,
	"desc": "Ads delivered from any ad-server on ad-event time",
	"adBreaks" : [
		{ "position" : "preroll", "ads" : 1 },
		{ "position" : 10, "ads" : 3 },
		{ "position" : 30, "ads" : 1 },
		{ "position" : 60, "ads" : 3 },
		{ "position" : "postroll", "ads" : 1 }
	],
	"profile" : ["html5", "mse-eme"]					
}
```

*Example format for DRM test. "drm" value may be playready/marlin/clearkey*
```json
{
	"title": "Tears of Steel AVC 1080p",
	"url": "videos/drm/manifest.mpd",
	"img": "videos/image_320x180.jpg",
	"la_url": "https://test.playready.microsoft.com/service/rightsmanager.asmx?cfg=(kid:header,sl:2000,persist:false,firstexp:60,contentkey:EjQSNBI0EjQSNBI0EjQSNw==)",
	"drm": "playready",
	"app": 6,
	"desc": "License URL override method"
}
```

Example action item: Clear javascript commands can be set to be evaluated with attribute *eval*
```json
{
    "title": "Check Internet Connection",
    "eval": "showInfo( (navigator.onLine )); ",
    "app": 0,
    "img": "icons/icons_1x1_checkinternet.png"
}
```

Example Out of band subtitles. Mandatory fields for *subtitle* array objects are *code* (language code for file) and *src* (file location). getSubs.php -subtitle proxy is preferred to use if the subtitle file is retreived from different origin server due to CORS issues with video player.

    "url": "manifest.mpd",
    "img": "icons/icons_1x1_out-of-band-subtitle.png",
    "app": 6,
	"desc": "TTML subtitles",
	"subtitles" : [{
        "code" : "eng",
        "src" : "../getSubs.php?file=https://different.host/sub_eng.xml"
    },
    {
        "code" : "fin",
        "src" : "sub_fin.xml"
    }],
	"profile" : ["html5", "mse-eme"]					
}
