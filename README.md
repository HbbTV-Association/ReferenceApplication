### Components and modules:

See components and modules listing at [integration] guide


### Catalogue menu structure:

Mainmenu, submenus, assets and actions are configured in __[config.json]__ file. 

The file can be changed to any endpoint for data to make static menu dynamic.

Menu structure for the catalogue app should respect used json structure that 
is designed to represent a vod catalogue build by mainmenu and submenus. 

Overall menu structure or datamodel is documented here: [datamodel]
